## Environment Setup

PostgreSQL must be running locally. The test database uses credentials `test:test` on `localhost:5432/base_app_test`. Do not waste time recreating it if it already exists.

Use `pipenv` for dependency management. Do not install packages or troubleshoot virtualenvs — assume the environment is set up.

## Testing

Read docs/testing-guide.md before writing or modifying any test. Always run tests — do not skip them.

```bash
pipenv run python -m pytest
```

## Documentation

When making a change that affects documented behaviour (new endpoints, model changes, config changes, enum additions, migration additions), update the relevant docs. When adding a new feature, review existing documentation in its entirety rather than just appending a new section. Other parts of the docs may reference the area you changed and need updating to stay accurate.

## Style

No meta commentary in code comments, commit messages, or documentation. State what the code does or why a decision was made. Do not narrate the act of writing it, explain that you made a change, or add filler like "This is a simple function that..." or "Updated to reflect the new...".
